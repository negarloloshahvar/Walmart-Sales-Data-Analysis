# Walmart-Sales-Data-Analysis

In this project I will analyze the Walmart Stores Sales dataset. Walmart Stores are a chians of department stores in the US.
This Dataset contains data about Walmart store departments which include ID number, store type, amount of weekly sales (in USD),
whether it was a holiday week, the average tempreture during the week (in Centigrade), average fuel price in each week per liter(in USD),
and the national unemployment rate that week.
