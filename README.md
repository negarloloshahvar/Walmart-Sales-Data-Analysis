# Walmart-Sales-Data-Analysis

In this project I will analyze the Walmart Stores Sales dataset. Walmart Stores are a chains of department stores in the US. This Dataset contains information about Walmart store departments which includes ID number for each store, store type, amount of weekly sales (in USD), whether it was a holiday week, the average tempreture during the week (in Centigrade), average fuel price in each week per liter(in USD), and the national unemployment rate that week.
